Django Entity Event
===================

Django Entity Event is a great way to collect events that your users
care about into a unified location. The parts of your code base that
create these events are probably totally separate from the parts that
display them, which are also separate from the parts that manage
subscriptions to notifications. Django Entity Event makes separating
these concerns as simple as possible, and provides convenient
abstractions at each of these levels.
